Evaluation of Art Adventures's Current Website
----------------------------------------------

## Current Colours
The website's color scheme is subdued and neutral, with white and light grays taking center stage. Headings and text occasionally employ darker colors (black or navy). 

### Problems:
- The website feels drab and uninspired due to the absence of accent colors.
- The color scheme lacks enthusiasm and inventiveness, two qualities that are essential for attracting new customers.

# Images

## Current Situation
The website's visual attractiveness is limited by the small number of photographs it contains. The current photos are generic and do not adequately represent the offers, which include events, workshops, and artwork.

### Problems:
- Insufficient use of visual storytelling to capture the spirit of Art Adventures' offerings.
- The lack of high resolution in the photographs takes away from the site's polished appearance.

# Fonts

## Available Fonts
The site has a generic vibe because of the typefaces' simplicity and default style, which is probably Arial or another similar sans-serif. Font weight and style aren't varied enough to provide a visual hierarchy.

### Problems:
- The typography is uninspired and does not reflect the company's creative spirit.
- Some sections have irregular font sizes and spacing, which makes them harder to read.
