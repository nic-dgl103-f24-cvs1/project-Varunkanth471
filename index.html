                    <p>"My 2 children have taken part in the day program for months now. They love the art projects & their time with Alicia at Art Adventures. They always come home with beautiful art & joyful stories of their day. Highly recommend Alicia's program"</p>

                    <p>"For Christmas, our adult family treated ourselves to a series of 5 art classes with “Art Adventures” Alicia is the owner and the instructor. We thoroughly enjoyed our sessions with her. We were taught the “Van Gogh” method of layering colours. This was new to me but I found it very interesting and the results were much better than any of us expected. I would recommend her to anyone, young or older to take the challenge of painting with Acrylic."</p>

She is an enthusiastic helper and has the patience and ability to explain and demonstrate the steps involved in the project at hand. I highly recommend her."</p>
